This file so far is mostly just notes from the easy 6502 page condensed for quick referance from me
numbers
  $ signifies hex
  # signifies literals
  anything else is a memory location

  for example
  L stands for load
  LDA #$01 loads the hex value 01 into register A
  LDA &01 loads the value from memory location hex 01 into register A

  T stands for transfer, TAX would transfer the value in the A register to X
  IN stands for increment, INX then, increments the value in the register X
  AD stands for Add, so ADX #$01 would add the hex value 01 to the register X
  BRK (break) ends the program
